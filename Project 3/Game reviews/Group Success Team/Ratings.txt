I would only download the source code to play around since there are functionality but not much implementation.
The code look interesting, too bad they are implemented in a not so good order.
Rendering the game have this weird (work in progress) feelings.
The game is not playable (it print out text and have options to choose but not a gameplay/story) It just have this unfinishes project feeling.
